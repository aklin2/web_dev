          <p>My name is Alan Lin.
              <br> An intermediate-level programmer that started off in Python, but now learning web development.
              <br>Currently learning the <span class="emphasis">holy trinity</span> of webdev: "html + css + javascript."
              <br>And this is my first attempt at a resume website.
        <!-- </p>
          <p>
            Back in 2016, I started off as a clinical tab tech at a molecular biology lab working on cancer screenings, carrier testing, metabolic disease testing, etc.
            <br>And got really good at the "wet" lab - i.e. wearing gloves, wearing lab coats, and handling dangerous chemicals in fume hoods, like you see in those drug commericals.
            <br>If you're not familiar with molecular labs, the general process goes like this: you extract the nucleic acids âž¡ run a library prep on them (generating "libraries" of information) âž¡ then sequence it.
            <br>Anything post-sequencing, i.e. post data collection was foreign to me. And I was determined to learn it.
            <br>So I spent 2019-2020 - a full year doing a deep-dive into Python and getting good at it. Was eventually hired that same year as a beginner bioinformatician - did a lot of batch and sample review.
            <br>But it did not feel like enough. I felt like an imposter in the field, since I wasn't doing any "real" bioinformatics - i.e. creating algorithms. Only data analysis on lab issues then plotting them.
            <br>So here I am, learning web dev. Hopefully to use this so that I can make applications for data analysis much easier for others to use.
